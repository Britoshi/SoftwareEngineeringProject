# Quarto

Quarto is a two-player strategy game played on a 4x4 board. Instead of placing your own pieces, you choose a piece for your opponent, creating a tactical puzzle about shared attributes.

## Goal

Create a line of four pieces that share at least one common attribute (such as shape, height(four corners), color(black and white), or fill/hollow(dot in center)). The first player to complete a qualifying line wins.

## How to Play

1. On your turn, draw/select a piece for your opponent to place. Look back to the board to check for the available pieces.
2. Your opponent places the selected piece on any open tile.
3. After placing, your opponent does the same for you.

# Quarto

Quarto is a two-player strategy game played on a 4x4 board. Instead of placing your own pieces, you choose a piece for your opponent, creating a tactical puzzle about shared attributes.

## Goal

Create a line of four pieces that share at least one common attribute (such as shape, height, color, or fill). The first player to complete a qualifying line wins.

## How to Play

1. On your turn, select a piece for your opponent to place.
2. Your opponent places the selected piece on any open square.
3. After placing, your opponent selects the next piece for you.

## Status

This minigame is the first entry in the project catalog and serves as the foundation for additional games that will be added later.
